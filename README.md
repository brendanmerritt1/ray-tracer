# Ray Tracer - An Animated Solar System Wallpaper Shader
A simple ray tracer in C++ and GLSL, adapted to create an animated solar system shader to be used as a desktop wallpaper.

<br />

## Demo
This project is hosted on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Dtlyzj) to demonstrate its animated and interactive nature. The mouse can be used as an input to move the solar system around.
The shader was then uploaded to Wallpaper Engine to be used as an animated wallpaper.

## Learning Process and Resources
As a starting point, the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) was used to gain an understanding of building a simple ray tracer.

[Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/articles/) provided many helpful reading resources and utility functions necessary for this project.
